            <h1>About the API</h1>
            <p>The Wanted API by the FBI contains information about not only the 10 Most Wanted Fugitives, but all of those on their wanted list.
                There are different categories including terrorism, fugitives, kidnappings, parental kidnappings, and more. There are also people
                on there who were kidnapped and are looking to find them to bring them home.
            </p>
            <p>When you click on a person in the api, it has information about them including:</p>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Date of Birth/Place of Birth</li>
                <li>Eyes, Hair, Height, Weight</li>
                <li>Race, Nationality, Languages</li>
                <li>Details, Reward, Caution</li>
                <li>Field office assigned to the case</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It also provides an image of every criminal and what they did to end up on the list. Not every criminal has every piece of information
                filled out, but it provides a good enough amount for the public to be able to potentially help in capturing these people.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the fugitives even have surveillance videos of them attached to their file. One of them for Alejandro Castillo can be
                seen below.
