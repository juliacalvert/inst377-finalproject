# Project Title: Exploring FBI's Most Wanted

# Description of Project: This project uses the FBI Most Wanted Database with the purpose of getting the information more widely available to people and presenting it in a way to make it easy to understand and pleasing. The website can also provide useful information to the FBI by allowing users to submit information about any of the suspects or criminals on the website. There are home and about pages containing more information about the site in general and showing examples of what can be found on the site like pictures and videos. The roulette page has a roulette of the top ten criminals on the most wanted list. The map page then puts a marker at the location where those people were last seen/committed the crime. There is also a Notify Us page where the user can submit that information about the criminals. They can also search for that crimial's name to see if the tip was already submitted and when.

# Description of Target Browsers: The target browser for this project would be something that could support JavaScript, HTML, APIs, cors, and more. Google Chrome would be best since that is what I was using and testing on for this project.
